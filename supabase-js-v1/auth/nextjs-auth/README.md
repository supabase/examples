# Example: Supabase Auth with Next.js and SSR

This example shows how to use Supabase auth both on the client and server in
both [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) and when
using [server side rendering
(SSR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering).

## Setting up

Install everything with npm or yarn:

`npm i` or `yarn i`

Go to your Supabase project API page and copy over the Project URL and Project
API key marked `anon` and `public`.

Make a copy of `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and place the values there.

You can then run the dev server using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
